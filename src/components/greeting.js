Hello, nice to meet you.

I'm a minimal note taking app inspired by Litewrite. I plan on working offline and to support remoteStorage.
Want to help me be better, star me on GitHub and report any issues of suggestions: https://github.com/Gangwolf/Writelite

Alright then, enjoy!

P.S. I also plan on support keyboard shortcuts, stay tuned!
